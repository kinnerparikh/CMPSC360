    \question[1]{Suppose $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$. If $4 | (a^2 + b^2)$, then $a$ and $b$ are not both odd.}

    Proof: Suppose $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$.

    For sake of contradiction, assume that $a$ and $b$ are both odd.

    By definition of odd, $a = 2x + 1$ and $b = 2y + 1$ such that $x,y \in \mathbb{Z}$

    By definition of divides, $a^2 + b^2 = 4z$ such that $z \in \mathbb{Z}$

    \vspace*{0.1cm}

    $a^2 + b^2 = (2x + 1)^2 + (2y + 1)^2 = 4z$

    \tabto*{1.7cm} $= 4x^2 + 4x + 1 + 4y^2 + 4y + 1 = 4z$

    \tabto*{1.7cm} $= 4x^2 + 4x + 4y^2 + 4y + 2 = 4z$

    \tabto*{1.7cm} $= 4t + 2$ such that $t \in \mathbb{Z}$ where $t = x^2 + x + y^2 + y$

    So, $4t + 2 \neq 4z$, which means $a^2 + b^2 \neq 4z$

    We have arrived at a contradiction, where $a^2 + b^2 = 4z$ and $a^2 + b^2 \neq 4z$ when $a$ and $b$ are odd

    Therefore, by sake of proof by contradiction, if $4 | (a^2 + b^2)$, then $a$ and $b$ are not both odd. $\square$

    \question[2]{Show that $\forall a,b \in \mathbb{Z},\ gcd(a, b) = b \leftrightarrow b \mid a. $}

    Proof:
    
    Suppose $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$

    \textbf{Case 1:} $gcd(a, b) = b \rightarrow b \mid a$

    \tabto{1cm} By definition, $gcd(a, b) = b$ means that $b \mid b$ and $b \mid a$ where $b \neq 0$

    \tabto{1cm} Therefore, $gcd(a, b) = b \rightarrow b \mid a$

    \textbf{Case 2:} $b \mid a \rightarrow gcd(a, b) = b $

    \tabto{1cm} Suppose $b \mid a$

    \tabto{1cm} We also know that $b \mid b$

    \tabto{1cm} By definition of $gcd$ and since $b \mid a$ and $b \mid b$, we can say that $gcd(a, b) = b$.

    \tabto{1cm} Therefore, $b \mid a \rightarrow gcd(a, b) = b$

    Therefore, $\forall a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, \ gcd(a, b) = b \leftrightarrow b \mid a\ \square$

    \question[3]{Is $\mathbb{R} = \{(x, y) \mid (x - y)\ \text{is divisible by}\ 17\}$ an equivalence relation?}

    Proof: Assume that $\mathbb{R} = \{(x, y) \mid (x - y)\ \text{is divisible by}\ 17\}$

    This means that $17 \mid (x-y)$

    By definition of divides $x - y = 17a$ such that $a \in \mathbb{Z}$

    For a statement to be an equivalence relation, it must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

    \textbf{Case 1:} reflexive

    \tabto{1cm} Assume $(x, x)$

    \tabto{1cm} so $x - y = 17a$ goes to $x - x = 17a$

    \tabto{1cm} This means that $0 = 17a$, for which this is a valid statement since $17 \mid 0$

    \tabto{1cm} So $\forall x \exists y\ y = x$ is true and $(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}$

    \tabto{1cm} Therefore, $\mathbb{R}$ is reflexive

    \textbf{Case 2:} Symmetric

    \tabto{1cm} Suppose $x - y = 17a$ for some $(x, y)$
    
    \tabto{1cm} To prove symmetry, take the case $(y, x)$

    \tabto{1cm} So, $y - x = 17b$ such that $b \in \mathbb{Z}$

    \tabto{1cm} Since this can simplify down to $-(x - y) = 17b$, we know that $b = -a$

    \tabto{1cm} Thus, $17 | (y - x)$ which means that $(y, x) \in \mathbb{R}$

    \tabto{1cm} Therefore, $\mathbb{R}$ is symmetric

    \textbf{Case 3:} Transitive

    \tabto{1cm} Proof for transitivity: $\exists a, b, c\ (a, b), (b, c) \in \mathbb{R} \rightarrow (a, c) \in \mathbb{R}$

    \tabto{1cm} Suppose $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}$

    \tabto{1cm} We can say that $17 \mid (a - b)$ and $17 \mid (b - c)$

    \tabto{1cm} By definition of divides, $a - b = 17p$ and $b - c = 17q$ such that $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$

    \tabto{1cm} By algebra, $a = 17p + b$ and $c = b - 17q$

    \tabto{1cm} So for $(a, c)$, we get $17 \mid (a - c)$

    \tabto{1cm} Substituting $a$ and $c$, $17 \mid [(17p + b) - (b - 17q)]$

    \tabto{3.98 cm} = $17 \mid (17p + b - b + 17q)$

    \tabto{3.98 cm} = $17 \mid (17p + 17q)$

    \tabto{3.98 cm} = $17 \mid [17(p + q)]$

    \tabto{3.98 cm} = $17 \mid 17t$ such that $t \in \mathbb{Z}$ where $t = p + q$

    \tabto{1cm} So, by definition of divides, we know that this is divisible by 17.

    \tabto{1cm} Therefore, $\mathbb{R}$ is transitive

    Since $\mathbb{R}$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, it is an equivalence relation. $\square$

    \question[4]{Suppose Neverland country (which is a fictional one), contains N cities. We define 
    relation $\mathbb{R}$ as follows: If there is a route between two cities $(c_i, c_j)$ for $1 \leq i, j \leq$ N, then we have
    $(c_i, c_j) \in \mathbb{R}$. We also assume that roads are in both directions in Neverland country. Is $\mathbb{R}$ an 
    equivalence relation? If so, what are the equivalence classes?}

    $\mathbb{R}$ is an equivalence relation.

    $[i] = \{j \leq (N - 1) \}$

    $[j] = \{i \leq (N - 1) \}$

    \question[5]{For $n$-dimensional vectors $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$, we would say $x \preceq y$ if for every $0 \leq i \leq n$, we
    would have $x_i \leq y_i$ where $x_i$ is the $i$-th element of $x$. Is $\preceq$ a partial order? Prove or disprove.}

    \question[7]{Let $f(x) = 2x$ where the domain is the set of real numbers. What is}

    (a) $f(\mathbb{N}) \rightarrow \{ x \in \mathbb{N} \mid 2x \}$

    (b) $f(\mathbb{Q}) \rightarrow \{ x \in \mathbb{Q} \mid 2x \}$

    (c) $f(\mathbb{R}) \rightarrow \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 2x \}$

    \question[8]{}

    (a) no properties

    (b) (4, 4)

    (c) (1, 2) and (4, 1)

    \question[9]{Let $A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots \}$ such that there are 4 elements in A. That is, $|A| = 4$. Similarly,
    let $B = \{b_1, b_2, \ldots \}$ such that $|B| = 2$. How many possible relations can be defined from $A$ to $B$?}



    \question[10]{Consider the set $A = {1, 2, 9, 11, 18}$ having relation
    $R = \{(1, 1), (2, 2), (9, 9), (11, 11), (18, 18), (1, 2), (2, 1), (11, 1), (1, 11), (18, 9), (9, 18) \}$, find 
    equivalence class of the following:}

    a) $[|1|] \rightarrow \{1, 2, 11\}$

    b) $[|2|] \rightarrow \{2, 1\}$

    c) $[|9|] \rightarrow \{9, 18\}$

    d) $[|11|] \rightarrow \{11, 1\}$

    e) $[|18|] \rightarrow \{18, 9\}$

    \question[11]{Let: $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by $f(x) = \frac{5x}{3} - 2$. Prove that $f$ is a one to one function.}

    Proof:

    Assume that $x_1$ and $x_2$ belong to $\mathbb{R}$

    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$

    \vspace*{0.1cm}

    Definition of the function $\frac{5x_1}{3} - 2 = \frac{5x_2}{3} - 2$

    \vspace*{0.1cm}

    \tabto*{5.15cm} $\frac{5x_1}{3} = \frac{5x_2}{3}$ \tabto*{8cm} Add 2 to both sides

    \tabto*{5.15cm} $5x_1 = 5x_2$ \tabto*{8cm} Multiply 3 by both sides

    \tabto*{5.33cm} $x_1 = x_2$ \tabto*{8cm} Divide both sides by 5

    Therefore, since $x_1 = x_2$, this is an injective function. $\square$

    \question[12]{Let: $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by $f(x) = \frac{x}{2} + 3$ a surjection (onto)? If it is, constructs the proof, 
    otherwise, give a counterexample.}

    Proof:

    Assume that $a \in \mathbb{R}$
    
    We must show that $\exists x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) = a$

    So, $a = \frac{x}{2} + 3$

    \tabto{1cm} $a-3 = \frac{x}{2}$

    \tabto{1cm} $2a - 6 = x$

    So, substituting for $x$, $f(x) = \frac{2a - 6}{2} + 3$

    \tabto{4.82cm} = $a - 3 + 3$

    \tabto{4.82cm} = $a$

    Since $f(x) = a$, we know that it is onto. $\square$
